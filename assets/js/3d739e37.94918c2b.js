I am a professional software engineer & crypto enthusiat.\\nAfter years of orbiting around the crypto world, I\'ve decided to get into it.\\nLanding into this world is incredible, but it is hard for a beginner to educate\\noneself. There are a lot of resources, but they are unorganized and scattered on\\nevery corner of the internet.\\n\\nLearning about cryptocurrencies is hard, time consuming, and usually requires to\\nmake (sometimes costly) mistakes. This is why I decided to create a \\"crypto guide\\"\\naimed to help absolute beginners learn about cryptocurrencies, NFTs, smart\\ncontracts, web 3.0, how to invest and earn money... For the devs out there, I also\\nwant to teach how to build dApps.\\n\\nThis [guide](/) is free and open source, and will remain that way.\\n\\nI will try to make this guide as honest, insightful and valuable as possible.\\n\\nI might accept sponsorships of products & services that I use and like in the\\nfuture, if I do, every product promoted in this guide will be clearly indicated.\\nBut I will try my best to make sure you can follow this guide without having to\\nbuy any of these products.\\n\\nAs of today (November 1st 2021), the guide is in the very early construction\\nphase. I am still educating myself, taking a lot of notes, experimenting. I am\\nwriting drafts & gathering ideas. The state of the guide is a draft, it\'s incomplete\\nand really bad, but I think it is important to ship it right now, it will help\\nmaking it better faster.\\n\\n:::caution\\nI am not a writer and I am not a native english speaker. I will try my best to\\nwrite simple coherent english sentences, but I will probably fail sometimes. I\\nalso have severe ADHD, and might just write incomplete sentences.\\n\\nHowever, I take my work seriously and will try my best to create the best guide\\never\\n:::"}]}')}}]);
