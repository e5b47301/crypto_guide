Hello, I am ae42faf7. I am a professional software engineer & crypto enthusiat.
After years of orbiting around the crypto world, I've decided to get into it.
Landing into this world is incredible, but it is hard for a beginner to educate
oneself. There are a lot of resources, but they are unorganized and scattered on
every corner of the internet.

Learning about cryptocurrencies is hard, time consuming, and usually requires to
make (sometimes costly) mistakes. This is why I decided to create a "crypto guide"
aimed to help absolute beginners learn about cryptocurrencies, NFTs, smart
contracts, web 3.0, how to invest and earn money... For the devs out there, I also
want to teach how to build dApps.

This [guide](../) is free and open source, and will remain that way.

I will try to make this guide as honest, insightful and valuable as possible.

I might accept sponsorships of products & services that I use and like in the
future, if I do, every product promoted in this guide will be clearly indicated.
But I will try my best to make sure you can follow this guide without having to
buy any of these products.

As of today (November 1st 2021), the guide is in the very early construction
phase. I am still educating myself, taking a lot of notes, experimenting. I am
writing drafts & gathering ideas. The state of the guide is a draft, it's incomplete
and really bad, but I think it is important to ship it right now, it will help
making it better faster.

:::caution
I am not a writer and I am not a native english speaker. I will try my best to
write simple coherent english sentences, but I will probably fail sometimes. I
also have severe ADHD, and might just write incomplete sentences.

However, I take my work seriously and will try my best to create the best guide
ever
