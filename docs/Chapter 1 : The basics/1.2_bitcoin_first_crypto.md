title: Bitcoin, The first cryptocurrency
---

Before we begin, this chapter will be very important to understand cryptocurrencies,
we will introduce a number of concepts that are necessary to safely invest in the
crypto world, like blockchain, hash function, public and private keys, transactions...
This chapter might be a little bit difficult and technical, but bear with me. I
will try to make it as simple as possible, without dumbing it down, and with a
bit of interactivity.

## The first cryptocurrency

Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency every built, the first "electronic payment
system based on cryptographic proof", hence the name crypto + currency.

Bitcoin first came out as a [white paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper).
You can read it on [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). It was linked
in a cryptography mailing list on October 31, 2008. The first activity recorded
on the Bitcoin network was made the 3rd of January 2009.

The creator of Bitcoin is "Satoshi Nakamoto". In reality nobody knows who "Satoshi
Nakamoto" is, because it's a pseudonym, it could be a single person or a group of
people. Nakamoto was very active in the early day of Bitcoin before completly
vanishing. If you are into conspiracies, you might believe that he/she's a time
traveller or an alien coming to help humanity.

The Bitcoin's white paper doesn't describe anything really new, its genius comes
from putting existing ideas and technologies together to build the first ever
decentralized, peer-to-peer network that allow 2 parties to make transactions
without the need of a trusted third party.


Multiple companies have tried to create an "e-currency", but all have failed.
According to Satoshi Nakamoto


## A response to the 2008 Financial Crisis

<!-- ntms: 
It's taking to long to write, I want to include a lot of things but it's really
hard to organise, I will need several iterations before getting something I like,
but for now, it will be good enough
so FOR LATER, remember to look at the note in crypto>notes (and in the extension)
search for dates around the 27 nov 2021.
 -->

Even though the creator of Bitcoin didn't clearly stated that bitcoin is a response
to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, strong evidences show that it is.

For a better understanding of what happened, you can read the article
[The financial Crisis and history of Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@noogin/the-financial-crisis-and-history-of-bitcoin-27ebdb932b99).

In short, quoting the article: 

> Numerous banks and financial institutions failed across the world and had to
> be bailed out by governments at the expense of their taxpayers.

:::note Bailout <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailout>
A bailout is the provision of financial help to a corporation or country which
otherwise would be on the brink of failure bankruptcy.
:::

So governements gave billions of $ to banks to save them, they even print more
money, participating to the inflation. <!-- OK I NEED MORE INFO ABOUT THIS -->

<!-- I want to talk about how gov can just print more money and how bitcoin has
a limited supply -->

> This underscored the fragility of the modern financial system, where the
> health of our monetary system is reliant on banks and other financial
> institutions that we are forced to trust to make wise and prudent decisions
> with the money we give them

This financial crisis highlighted how banks can make really bad decisions and 
lose its customers' money. 

Banks in almost all countries worldwide use fractional-reserve banking. Banks
that take deposits from the public are required to keep a proportion of the
deposits in liquid assets as a reserve, and can do whatever they want with the
rest. The reverse requirement (minimum quantity of liquidity) depends of countries,
in the US it's generally 10%. It's fine most of the time, but if people decide to
take their deposits back, the bank can quickly become out of liquidity and unable
to give people's money back.

September of 2008 is considered to be the climax of the crisis, and Bitcoin white
paper was published in October. In the first block of data published on the Bitcoin
network, Nakamoto wrote an "hidden message": “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor
on brink of second bailout for banks.” quoting The Times NewsPaper about the
British government’s failure to react to the financial crisis

Remember in the last chapter, when we discussed about how we needed to trust
banks to operate. Banks and trust seemed to be the main concerns of Satoshi
Nakamoto, he expressed these problems in a [forum's post](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source):

> The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required
> to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency,
> but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks
> must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they
> lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We
> have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves
> drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.

From the white paper:

> What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof
> instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with
> each other without the need for a trusted third party

And Bitcoin do just that: it eliminates the need of trust, of a trusted 3rd
party. Bitcoin allows people to exchange one to one in a trustless environment.

<!--

at this point, you should know what bitcoin is trying to do:
build an electronic payment system without the need of trust

I think I go back to my initial idea to talk about it as how can we build bitcoin
more than how does bitcoin work

so first talk how bitcoin is a ledger: a list of transactions.
A double entry ledger: input(s) (sender/debit) output(s) (receiver/credit).

Ledgers usually are controlled by a central authority like a bank to be able to
verify the validity of the transactions and make sure someone has the funds to
be able to make the transaction : no double spending.
=> Problem trust

To remove the need of trust, bitcoin removes the central authority, by creating
a decentralized network of computers (or nodes) each capable of verifying transactions,
and agreeing on the source of truth, we will see later how they do it.

Ok and now, maybe I go through an example of a transaction, and explain everything
from key pairs, wallet, blockchain, mining, proof of work, timestamp...

# How does it work ?

One of the best resources to understand how Bitcoin works is the [white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).
However it's not the easiest to understand. If you like videos better, you can
watch the excellent 26 min video "[But how does bitcoin actually work?](https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4)"
made by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw).
If you really want to get into the details, you can read the book "[Mastering Bitcoin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-bitcoin/9781491902639/)" by [Andreas M.Antonopoulos](https://aantonop.com/about/)
(legendary Bitcoin educator, a name you should remember), but it's old and not up to date.

But let me try to make the best explanation ever.

Let's say Alice wants to send 3 bitcoins to Bob. (Yes Alice is balling 🤑). How
can she do it ? How does it work ?

First, Alice needs to have at least 3 bitcoins, otherwise she will not be able
to send it to Bob. You can't send something you don't have, which is pretty logic,
but that's something you can do with the current financial system (short selling),
with Bitcoin no crazy stuff like this.

Ok, but what does it mean to have bitcoin ? Where is it stored ?
Let's first ignore how alice got her bitcoin, we will come back to this later.

<!--
 Users sign transactions with the keys, thereby proving they own the transaction
 outputs (their coins).
 
 The coins are stored on the blockchain in the form of transaction-ouputs (often
 noted as vout or txout, or UTxO).

 from <https://braiins.com/blog/explain-like-im-not-a-developer-taproot-privacy>
 the Bitcoin blockchain is a record of what’s known as Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs). Once a UTXO is used as an input in another transaction, it cannot be used again (as it is no longer “unspent”)
-->

Know that there isn't actual coins, there no gold, no material... bitcoins are
pieces of digital informations: bits, hence the name bitcoin. Bitcoins are literal
pieces of information/data written in files stored on multiple computers. Just like
this page, which is an HTML file stored on [Github's servers](https://github.com/e5b47301/crypto_guide/tree/gh-pages/docs/Chapter%201%20:%20The%20basics).

<!-- Some people talk about bitcoin as energy (electricity) turned into value. -->

Now, let's talk about how the data is structured and what it contains.
So, let's say

<!-- I need to talk about the decentralized network -->
<!-- A global distributed ledger: the blockchain -->

You should think of bitcoin as a double-entry bookkeeping ledger. 


<!-- Chain of ownership -->
To transfer bitcoins someone own, he needs to unlock them.
To transfer her bitcoins, Alice takes Bob's public key and add it to the transaction,

<!-- bitcoin address -->
Public key -> some operation/function -> bitcoin address
The reason why we use Bitcoin addresses and not directly the public key is to
shorten the size of the address and by doing so, saving disk space. (and diminishing
the probability to make errors while typing an address (because less characters)).
There are different types and/or version of addresses, to add functionnalities,
and reduces transaction size. The existing types of addresses are:

* Legacy addresses (P2PKH)
* Pay to Script Hash (P2SH)
* Native SegWit (P2WPKH)
* Taproot (P2TR)

They all can be used, the most used as of today (November 2021) is the Native SegWit,
because it gives the smallest network fees.
Taproot addresses were introduced in November 2021, so are very recent.

# How are bitcoins created ? Mining

// just a bunch of ideas
* Bitcoins are created by a process called mining.
* Mining is the action of creating a block
* The first block is called the genisis block. It has only 1 transaction: a reward
the miner gave himself for successfully mining the block (solving the proof of work problem).
This transaction is called "coinbase transaction". (Coinbase refers to the transaction that is automatically created in every Bitcoin block to pay the reward to the block miner)
