title: Innovating money
---

People have needs & wants, and a lot of them, but we are unable to produce or
fulfill all of them by ourselves. However most people are able to produce one
type of product or provide one type of service, giving them the ability to trade
one product or service for another one.

The first type of trade ever made was bartering : trading a product/service for
another. For example if Bob has an apple & Alice has a banana, he can trade his
apple for a banana. It works well if Alice wants an apple, but if she wants a
potatoe instead, she will not accept Bob's offer. For Bob to get Alice's banana,
he will need to find someone who has a potatoe & wants an apple, introducing
more people in the trade.
Bartering has a lot of problems : it's hard to find people to trade with,
matching product/services of equivalent value is hard, and the ability to trade
is linked to the ability to produce a product & service. Apples only grow on
trees once a year...

Instead of relying on direct trade between products & services, people gathered
and agreed to use something as a medium of exchange : money. Money is an item or
verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services,
and repayment of debts. The first examples of money were commodities, an
economically useful good whose units are interchangeable. For example, we can
think about bottles of water as a commodity money. Everybody needs to drink,
everybody can accept water as a payment.
Having bottles of water as a medium of payment allows to trade any sort of goods
and services. However, they have big problems : 

- they are hard to store & transport (they take a lot of place & are heavy)
- water is abundant, it's value is low, and to be able to trade for
sophisticated product, one would need a lot of them
- they are easy to steal

One solution to some of these problems is to use a commodity that's more
convenient, like gold. Gold is a solid and can be turned into small tokens:
coins. Coins are small and light, easy to cary and trade. Gold is rare enough to
find and extract, so it's value is high, but it's common enough that it's
possible to find more. Gold doesn't degrade over time.

Gold & precious metal don't have everyday usage, you can't eat it, or use it to
heat your home, but people agree that it has value.

Today, most people use "fiat money" : like U.S. dollars (US$), euros (€), Indian
rupee (₹), Japanese yen (¥), pounds sterling (£) ... Fiat money does not have
any intrinsic value, and is usually made of a worthless or low-value material.
The value comes from a collective agreement, typically supported by a governement
regulation that enforces its use & value.

Gold coins are convenient, easy to trade & transport, but if you have a large
amount it's hard to safely store. Putting it under your bed is not safe and
could be easily stolen. Once stolen, a thief can use it to trade and it's almost
impossible to tell that it was stolen.

Instead of storing gold coins themselves, people trust banks to do it for them,
using vaults & armed security guards. Banks are now the one holding the
commodity. To let people keep trading, they deliver bank notes (cash, bills) to
its costumers that they can use to trade. But Bank notes can be stolen & can be
counterfeited.

To try to prevent from thieves using bank notes that they stole, banks create
"cheques". A paper form, that link the buyer, money sender to his/her bank
account. When Bob wants to buy Alice banana's, he can fill his cheque, with the
amount of money Alice wants, and sign it. Alice then needs to go to the bank,
the bank verifies the validity of the cheque, and transfers the money from Bob's
bank account to Alice's bank account. However, cheques suffer from a lot of
problem :

- they can be tampered, Alice can decided to modify the amount written on the
check
- they can be counterfeited, Marvin, can decide to create a fake cheque and
imitate Bob's signature
- Bob can try to spend his money several times, money that he doesn't have. If
Bob's balance is 10 gold coins, and make 2 cheques of 10 coins, one of the cheques
will not be valid, and one person will not be paid. This is known as the
"double-spending problem"

Conscious of all these issues, banks introduced credit & debit card. Credit/Debit
card are easy to use & transports, they allow to make secure transactions from
one bank account to another, before making the transactions, banks will
automatically verify the balance of the buyer/sender. The buyer will not be able
to double-spend.
Problems of credit/debit cards :

- Need to share private informations, that can be stolen (cards numbers)
- Rely on 3rd party : banks, you need to trust the bank. There is no possible
direct trade between 2 people. Fees, 3rd parties & middlemen introduces fees to
earn money. Banks usually have a lot of control on what you do, and can decide
to decline a transaction or limit the amount you can spend.
- Can be slow, some transactions will happened between different banks, using
different currencies, which can take several days to complete.

What if you left blue land, to start living in dream land, you make money in
dream land, and decide to send money to your family once in while. If a
diplomatic relationships degrade between the 2 countries, you will not be able
to send money to your family anymore. Relying on governements & banks is a
mistake.

Some countries are unstable, don't have governments, banks or even currencies.
People living in these places don't have other choice but to rely on bartering,
they are the unbanked.

As you saw, creating a monetary system is extremely difficult, and all the
previous solutions have their problems.

Cryptocurrencies try to solve all of these problems.
