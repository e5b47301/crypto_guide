---

// TODO: put some facts

* Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency.
* Created by Satoshi Nakamoto
  * White Paper in 2008
  * First block when ?
* small note on who tf is Satoshi Nakamoto
  * nobody knows who he is ? aliens ?
  * not active anymore

----------------

Before we begin, this chapter will be very important to understand cryptocurrencies,
we will introduce a number of concepts that are necessary to safely invest in the
crypto world, like blockchain, hash function, public and private keys, transactions...
This chapter might be a little bit difficult and technical, but bear with me. I
will try to make it as simple as possible, without dumbing it down.

# A response to the 2008 Financial Crisis

THE BIGGEST ISSUE OF THE CURRENT FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS THE AMOUNT OF TRUST IT REQUIRES.
Trust the banks, trust the governments...

From the white paper:

# How does it work ?

One of the best resources to understand how Bitcoin works is the [white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).
However it's not the easiest to understand. If you like videos better, you can
watch the excellent 26 min video "[But how does bitcoin actually work?](https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4)"
made by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw).
If you really want to get into the details, you can read the book "[Mastering Bitcoin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-bitcoin/9781491902639/)" by [Andreas M.Antonopoulos](https://aantonop.com/about/)
(legendary Bitcoin educator, a name you should remember).

But let me try to make the best explanation ever.

Let's say Alice wants to send 3 bitcoins to Bob. (Yes Alice is balling ðŸ¤‘). How
can she do it ? How does it work ?

First, Alice needs to have at least 3 bitcoins, otherwise she will not be able
to send it to Bob. You can't send something you don't have, which is pretty logic,
but that's something you can do with the current financial system (short selling),
with Bitcoin no crazy stuff like this.

Ok, but what does it mean to have bitcoin ? Where is it stored ?
Let's first ignore how alice got her bitcoin, we will come back to this later.

Know that there isn't actual coins, there no gold, no material... bitcoins are
pieces of digital informations: bits, hence the name bitcoin. Bitcoins are literal
pieces of information/data written in files stored on multiple computers. Just like
this page, which is an HTML file, is stored on [Github's servers](https://github.com/e5b47301/crypto_guide/tree/gh-pages/docs/Chapter%201%20:%20The%20basics).

// Some people talk about bitcoin as energy (electricity) turned into value.


Now, let's talk about how the data is structured and what it contains.
So, let's say

// I need to talk about the decentralized network

You should think of bitcoin as a double-entry bookkeeping ledger.

# How are bitcoins created ? Mining

// just a bunch of ideas
* Bitcoins are created by a process called mining.
* Mining is the action of creating a block
* The first block is called the genisis block. It has only 1 transaction: a reward
the miner gave himself for successfully mining the block (solving the proof of work problem).
This transaction is called "coinbase transaction". (Coinbase refers to the transaction that is automatically created in every Bitcoin block to pay the reward to the block miner)
  * mysteries associated with the genisis block & other stuff : <https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/genesis-block.asp#:~:text=Another%20puzzling%20aspect%20of%20the,of%20second%20bailout%20for%20banks.%22&text=Nakamoto%20famously%20hated%20the%20idea,be%20different%20in%20that%20regard.>
* You can go through the whole chain with a tool called a blockchain explorer,
starting at [block 0](https://blockstream.info/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f?expand)
